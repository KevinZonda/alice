# Alice Runtime Architecture

[中文版本](./architecture.zh-CN.md)

This document describes the current target architecture after the runtime/skills refactor shipped on March 13, 2026.

## Design goals

- Keep the connector process focused on orchestration, not prompt literals or tool-specific business logic.
- Treat LLM backends as interchangeable adapters.
- Move chat-scoped operational capabilities into reusable skills that talk to Alice through a local HTTP API.
- Keep MCP as a compatibility layer for media/file tools instead of the primary expansion surface.
- Make debug traces auditable: every agent call should record markdown input/output/tool activity.

## Component map

- `cmd/connector`
  Starts the Feishu connector, automation engine, and local runtime HTTP API in one process group.
- `internal/connector`
  Handles Feishu websocket intake, queueing, session serialization, interruption, reply dispatch, and per-run env injection.
- `internal/llm`
  Backend factory plus provider adapters for `codex`, `claude`, and `kimi`.
- `internal/prompting`
  File-backed prompt/template renderer using Go templates plus `sprig`.
- `internal/memory`
  Scoped memory storage and prompt assembly, plus HTTP-friendly snapshot/update helpers.
- `internal/automation`
  Task persistence/execution for `send_text`, `run_llm`, and `run_workflow`.
- `internal/runtimeapi`
  Local authenticated HTTP server and client used by skills and MCP proxies.
- `internal/mcpserver`
  Compatibility MCP surface. Media/file tools prefer the runtime HTTP API and fall back to direct sender behavior.
- `skills/`
  Runtime-facing operational skills such as `alice-memory`, `alice-scheduler`, and `alice-code-army`.

## Prompt system

Prompts are no longer embedded as large string literals in code paths.

- Prompt root: `prompts/`
- LLM initial prompt template: `prompts/llm/initial_prompt.md.tmpl`
- Memory prompt template: `prompts/memory/prompt.md.tmpl`
- Code Army phase templates:
  - `prompts/code_army/manager.md.tmpl`
  - `prompts/code_army/worker.md.tmpl`
  - `prompts/code_army/reviewer.md.tmpl`

`internal/prompting` loads templates from disk, caches compiled templates with `xxhash`, and exposes `sprig` helpers for richer prompt logic.

## Backend abstraction

The backend factory now supports:

- `codex`
- `claude`
- `kimi`

Key behaviors:

- Shared high-level `llm.Backend` contract remains stable.
- `kimi` uses the local `kimi` CLI in print/stream-json mode and reuses Alice session ids as Kimi session ids.
- Providers that do not support MCP registration, such as `kimi`, simply skip MCP auto-registration.

## Runtime HTTP API

The connector now exposes a local authenticated HTTP API, intended for skills and thin proxies.

Current API groups:

- `/api/v1/messages/*`
  Send text/image/file into the current chat context.
- `/api/v1/memory/*`
  Inspect memory context, rewrite long-term memory, append daily summaries.
- `/api/v1/automation/*`
  Create/list/get/patch/delete scheduled tasks.
- `/api/v1/workflows/code-army/status`
  Inspect `code_army` workflow state for the current conversation.

Configuration:

- `runtime_http_addr`
- `runtime_http_token`

If `runtime_http_token` is omitted, the connector generates a per-process token and injects it into agent environments.

## Skills model

Operational modules are now exposed as skills instead of being reachable only through MCP tools:

- `skills/alice-memory`
  Inspect/update current chat memory through `scripts/alice-memory.sh`.
- `skills/alice-scheduler`
  Manage automation tasks and workflow status through `scripts/alice-scheduler.sh`.
- `skills/alice-code-army`
  Now composes with `alice-scheduler` instead of invoking MCP automation tools directly.

These skills rely on:

- `ALICE_RUNTIME_API_BASE_URL`
- `ALICE_RUNTIME_API_TOKEN`
- existing session env such as `ALICE_MCP_RECEIVE_ID`, `ALICE_MCP_SESSION_KEY`, and related actor metadata

## MCP strategy

MCP is no longer the preferred extension surface for Alice business operations.

Current posture:

- Skills + runtime HTTP are the primary path for memory/scheduling/workflow operations.
- `alice-mcp-server` remains available for compatibility.
- `send_image` and `send_file` now prefer the runtime HTTP client path and fall back to direct sender behavior when the local runtime API is unavailable.

This keeps legacy Codex MCP behavior alive while reducing duplication between skills and MCP handlers.

## Debug traces

When `log_level=debug`, every agent call emits a markdown trace containing:

- provider
- agent name
- thread/session id
- model/profile
- rendered input
- observed tool calls
- final output or error

This applies to:

- normal assistant runs
- scheduler-triggered `run_llm`
- `code_army` phase agents (`manager`, `worker`, `reviewer`)
- backend adapters that can surface tool activity (`codex`, `kimi`, and partial `claude`)

## Library adoption in this refactor

Actively used:

- `github.com/Masterminds/sprig/v3`
- `github.com/cespare/xxhash/v2`
- `github.com/evanphx/json-patch/v5`
- `github.com/gin-gonic/gin`
- `github.com/go-resty/resty/v2`
- `github.com/oklog/run`
- `github.com/oklog/ulid/v2`
- `github.com/rs/zerolog`
- `github.com/spf13/cobra`
- `go.etcd.io/bbolt`
- `gopkg.in/natefinch/lumberjack.v2`
- `gopkg.in/yaml.v3`

## End-to-end flow

1. Feishu event enters `internal/connector`.
2. Connector serializes work per session and builds per-run env.
3. Env includes current chat context plus runtime HTTP auth.
4. LLM backend renders prompt templates from disk and runs `codex`/`claude`/`kimi`.
5. Skills invoked by the agent call the runtime HTTP API through bundled shell scripts.
6. Runtime HTTP API operates memory, automation, and message sending using the same session context.
7. Automation tasks are persisted in `automation.db` through `bbolt`, migrating legacy JSON snapshots on first open.
8. Runtime logs are emitted through `zerolog`, with optional file rotation handled by `lumberjack`.
9. Debug traces record each agent call in markdown for replay/audit.
